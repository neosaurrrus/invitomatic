# Invitely - A simple real-time event scheduling App

This is a cool little thing to quickly get a bunch of people to agree on dates they can do.

You know the scenario, you want to go paintballing, watch the latest blockbuster, do some karioke. Getting your friends to agree a date is hard!

So how about we make a page when we say what we want to do, and when we can do it and then share that page with our pals?

They can adjust the dates based on thier own availibility, hopefully ending up with a bunch of dates we can all do. Cool thing is that you dont even have to refresh the page to see what people can do!

Still, plenty of work to be done on it but in a basic way it works.

Created with React and Firebase mostly.
